## Histogram Techniques in MATLAB  

### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project focuses on implementing image enhancement techniques, specifically **Histogram Equalization** and **Histogram Specification**, using MATLAB. These methods adjust image contrast and brightness to improve visual clarity, making them widely used in applications such as medical imaging, satellite image processing, and forensic analysis.  

### ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights  
- âœ… **Custom MATLAB Implementation**: Avoids built-in functions to gain deeper insights into the process.  
- âœ… **Grayscale & Color Image Processing**: Applies enhancement techniques to both formats.  
- âœ… **Filtering & Edge Detection**: Additional image processing methods (Gaussian blur, sharpening, edge detection, etc.) are included for comparison.
